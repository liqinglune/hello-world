# hello-world

You can call me Celine.
I have been working in mobile devices industry for 11 years.
Knowing nothing about coding before, I always believe that coding is so cool because it is all about pure creation.

Really hope to get some basic coding skills after this training programme so that I will be able to create something to make my life a better one.
